5) How many rows are there for the Yellow Taxi data for the March 2021 CSV file?

  To complete this load, we'll need to either modify the yaml in the 06_gcp_taxi inputs for year to allow 2001 in the dropdown or ensure that the "ensureCustomValue" prope\
rty in year is set to true to allow us to type in 2021 manually when running the flow.

  SELECT count(*) FROM `ny-rides-thomm-fullery.zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata` where filename = 'yellow_tripdata_2021-03.csv';
